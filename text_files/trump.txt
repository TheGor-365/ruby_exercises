Donald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is the 45th and current president of the
United States. Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television personality.
Trump was born and raised in Queens, a borough of New York City, and received a bachelor's

casinos, and golf courses. Trump later started various side ventures, mostly by licensing
his name. He produced and hosted The Apprentice, a reality television series, from 2003 to
